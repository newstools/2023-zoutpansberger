The Makhado police have launched a massive manhunt for a group of heavily armed suspects who attacked and shot at police members transporting six trial-awaiting prisoners and managed to free them this morning, 13 March, along the Vivo road next to the Schoemansdal turn-off outside Louis Trichardt. The suspects thereafter took the six prisoners and sped off in a grey Mercedes Benz and a white Toyota bakkie. All the escapees are Zimbabwean nationals. They are Forward Shumba (26), Shingirai Nyandome (32), Brilliant Sibanda (26), Erick Sithole (35), Moses Zambara (32) and Alex Nkomo (35). “The first five were arrested for aggravated robbery, three counts of attempted murder and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. The last one was arrested for theft of cables,” said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe has ordered the mobilisation of the necessary police resources, including the airwing, to hunt down the escapees and the suspects. “People are advised not to approach the suspects under any circumstances as they are considered dangerous but must call the police instead,” said Mojapelo. Anyone with information can contact Colonel Nyelisani Mabatha at Tel 082 565 8171, the crime stop number at 08600 10111 or may send a message via MySAPSApp.

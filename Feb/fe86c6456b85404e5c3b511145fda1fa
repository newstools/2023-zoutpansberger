The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said they were content with the sentences that were handed down against a former deputy director at the Kutama Sinthumule Correctional Facility (SACM) outside Louis Trichardt, Musiiwa Clement Raphalalani (57), by the Sibasa Regional Court on 31 January. During 2017, Raphalalani, who was a procurement officer at the facility, connived with his apparent lover, Delicia Sadiki, to award tenders to Vhalenda Zwashu Trading Enterprise without following due process. Raphalalani and his co-accused were arrested during a sting operation by the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation members in December 2018. The Hawks’ investigation revealed that Sadiki is a director of Vhalenda Zwashu Trading Enterprise. The company benefitted R10.8 million from these corrupt activities. On 20 October 2022, the court found Raphalalani guilty on nine counts of fraud and corruption and the case was postponed to 31 January 2023 for sentencing. During sentencing last week, Raphalalani was sentenced to a fine of R12 000 or three years’ imprisonment on count one; a R15 000 fine or 15 months’ imprisonment on count two; a fine of R20 000 or six years’ imprisonment on count three, a fine of R15 000 or five years’ imprisonment on count four; a fine of R14 000.00 or four years’ imprisonment on count five; a fine of R8 000 or two years’ imprisonment on count six; a fine of R25 000 or seven years’ imprisonment on count 7; a fine of R10 000 or 36 months’ imprisonment on count 8; and a fine of R8 000 or 18 months’ imprisonment on count nine. In total, Raphalalani was fined  R120 000 or 32 years’ imprisonment. The provincial head of the Hawks in Limpopo, Major General Gopz Govender, applauded the investigation team for their sterling work that led to the conviction and sentencing of the accused on numerous counts of fraud and corruption. “I would like to extend my gratitude to the prosecution team and the judiciary for ensuring that justice prevails,” he added.

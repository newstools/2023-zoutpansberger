The SAPS in Louis Trichardt are investigating an armed robbery at the local post office in Krogh Street on Monday, 6 February. According to an eyewitness who was present at the time, the post office officials were busy preparing to assist clients when seven men entered the building, pretending to be waiting in line with the rest. Suddenly, one of the suspects pushed to the front and jumped inside the tellerâ€™s working area, pointing a gun at the cashier and ordering her to lie down. He ordered the workers to hand him money, while the other suspects pointed guns at the clients. One of the staff members at the post office told Limpopo Mirror that they were still in shock after the incident and that the management had arranged counselling for the employees. Police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that the police are on a manhunt for seven suspects who had fled with an undisclosed amount of money. He appealed to anyone with relevant information to contact the nearest police station.

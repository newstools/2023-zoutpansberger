Limpopo police are yet to make a breakthrough in the search for the suspects responsible for a daring early-morning armed robbery at the well-known BP filling station in Rissik Street, Louis Trichardt, on 27 January. According to the police, the armed robbery took place just after 07:00, shortly after a security company had arrived to collect the filling station’s cash. The suspects were apparently masked, while some posed as customers inside the Pick ‘n Pay Express shop on the premises. The suspects made their gateway with an undisclosed amount of money in a white Hyundai hatchback in the direction of the N1. Unconfirmed reports indicated that the vehicle was found abandoned near the old dumping site along the Vondeling Road. These reports later proved to be untrue. The Makhado police confirmed on Wednesday that no arrests have been made in connection with the case. Members of the public who can assist the police in their investigation are urged to phone the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Tshifhiwa Netshia, at Tel 066 263 4915.

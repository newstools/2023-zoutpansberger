Limpopo police have made a breakthrough with the arrest of six suspects in connection with a farm attack and robbery on the well-known game farm Greater Kuduland Safari’s in the Tshipise area. The attack took place during the evening of 27 December. At about 21:15 on that evening, a group of armed suspects entered the farm and assaulted the wife of the farm owner. They demanded to know where the cash and other valuables were kept, going on to steal eleven firearms, an undisclosed amount of cash in Rands, US Dollars and British Pounds, as well as a laptop and a cellphone, before fleeing the scene in the farmer's Toyota Land Cruiser. Following the robbery, Limpopo police vowed that they would work around the clock to bring the perpetrators to book. Their hard work paid off with the arrest of six suspects on Wednesday evening, 11 January. The arrests follow an intelligence driven operation by members of the Trio Task Team. The suspects were arrested at four different locations, namely Makushu village, Musekwa village, Tshituni village and on the Greater Kuduland farm itself. Following the arrests, police managed to recover eight (five rifles and three handguns) of the 11 stolen firearms, 188 rounds of live ammunition, a night vision camera, a set of Nikon binoculars, silver plated coins, several items of jewellery, a bag full of different foreign currencies and a box with different South African old coins. The suspects, four South Africans and two foreign nationals aged between 27 and 38, will appear in the Musina Magistrate’s Court facing charges of house robbery, unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition and the possession of suspected stolen properties.

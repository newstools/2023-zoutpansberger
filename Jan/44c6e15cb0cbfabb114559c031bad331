A reward of R20 000 has been issued by a Louis Trichardt company for the return of their company vehicle, which went missing with its driver on 9 December last year. According to Mr Vernon Wilhase of the company Jushan Enterprises ( Pty) Ltd, they had sent their driver to make a R9 000 deposit on behalf of the company’s bakery (Daily Bread) at the local Standard Bank branch early that morning, using the company’s 2019 Mahindra bakkie with a high-rise canopy. “By 14:00 that day, I decided to drive to the bank to find out where our driver was, because we got worried why he was taking so long. To my shock I was informed that he never arrived at the bank and was in fact missing,” said Wilhase. Wilhase made some inquiries as to where their driver stayed and visited the premises in Tshikota. His worst fears became true. “I was told that he came back to his room early that morning, hurriedly took all his possessions and sped off at high speed,” said Wilhase. Wilhase said he eventually managed to have the case reported to the Makhado police the next day. This was after he found that their driver had allegedly stolen his employee file from the admin office. He was also informed that the man was apparently also sought by the Mokopane police in connection with another criminal charge. Makhado police spokesperson Constable Irene Radzilane confirmed on Tuesday that they were investigating a case of the use of a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent, not vehicle theft, because the vehicle was given to the driver. She stated, however,  that more charges could be added by the state prosecutor, should the man be apprehended. In the meantime, she urged anyone with information about the case to phone the investigating officer, detective sergeant Rirhandzu Ntsanwisi, at 072 537 5960. Regarding this she said that the 39-year-old Mr Mogale Charles Lesetja from Seshego Zone 3 might be able to assist the police in their investigation.
